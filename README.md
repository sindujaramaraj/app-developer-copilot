# App Developer Copilot

A VS Code extension that helps you create react-native mobile applications using Copilot. This is a preview version of the extension and works better with Claude models.

## Features

- Create mobile apps using React Native and Expo
- Generate application architecture and component designs
- Automatically generate TypeScript code for components
- Handle project setup and dependency management
- Uses expo-router for navigation and react-native-paper for theming

## Requirements

- Node.js v16.0.0 or higher
- Visual Studio Code 1.95.0 or higher

## Usage

1. Open copilot chat window
2. Select Claude model
3. Type "@app-developer-mobile" to start a chat with the extension
4. Use "/create" command to create a new mobile application
5. Use "/run" command to run the generated application
6. Use "/design" command to generate a detailed roadmap or build plan
7. Use "/build" command to build the application
8. Use "/deploy" command to deploy the application
9. The extension will:
   - Generate app architecture diagram
   - Create an Expo project
   - Generate component code
   - Install required dependencies
   - Perform comprehensive pre-checks and validations to ensure all necessary dependencies and configurations are in place before starting the app creation process

Once the app is generated, you can run the app using the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator.
Please note: There might be issues after app generation. You can manually fix them by following the error messages in the terminal.
